   <h3>Berlin - Hauptstadt der Deutschland</h3>
  <p>
    Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include
    its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century
    Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks
    like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.

   <h3>Vienna - Hauptstadt des Österreich</h3>
  <p>
    Vienna, Austria’s capital, lies in the country’s east on the Danube River. Its artistic and intellectual legacy was
    shaped by residents including Mozart, Beethoven and Sigmund Freud. The city is also known for its Imperial palaces,
    including Schönbrunn, the Habsburgs’ summer residence. In the MuseumsQuartier district, historic and contemporary
    buildings display works by Egon Schiele, Gustav Klimt and other artists.
